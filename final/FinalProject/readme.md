# Final Project - To Do List

This is my final project for CSE210, this project is a To Do list. It starts by asking for your name. If you have used the program before it will find and load any information that you have already added. If you are a new user you will be prompted to take a short survey to discover what type of to do items you will be adding. 

## How to start the application

Start by running the Main program in the program.cs file. 

## Types of To Do Items

There are 5 main to do item types which are:
1. Work
2. School
3. Home
4. Car
5. General

Each to do item will have specific data tied for them. For example, if you create a school to do item, you can add what class it is for. Or if you add a Work to do item, you can add who you need to report back to on a specific task.
